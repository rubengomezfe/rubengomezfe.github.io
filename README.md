  <h2>Profile</h2>
  <p>
    I am an anthropologist researching how moral finance and racial capitalism manifest
    in the context of indigenous banks in Ecuador. My interests span land tenure, food
    systems, indigeneity, and financialization, with an emphasis on how these dynamics
    unfold in everyday institutional and social practice.
  </p>
  <p>
    My analytical approach draws on Marxist and Foucauldian traditions, which I use to
    nuance top-down theories of capitalism, racialization, and the nation-state by
    grounding them in lived experience. Methodologically, I work with multiple forms
    of ethnography, specializing in participant observation, multispecies, digital,
    and autoethnography.

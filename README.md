<h1>Cultural Anthropologist and Social Science Researcher</h1>

<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>
I am an anthropologist researching how moral finance and racial capitalism manifest in the context of indigenous banks in Ecuador. My interests combine the studies of land tenure, food systems, indigeneity, and financialization. My main analytical tools are based on Marxist and Foucauldian traditions through which I aim to add nuance to top-down theories on capitalism, racialization, and the nation-state by comparing them to people's lived experiences. I have experience in multiple types of ethnography, specializing in participant observation, multispecies, digital, and autoethnography, which allows me to integrate varied empirical cases into theoretical discussions.
